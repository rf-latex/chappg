Chappg -- number pages per chapter.

This package is a development of a LaTeX 2.09 package of the same name
by Max Hailperin, which was originally distributed in the good old
online TeXMaG periodical.

The original idea was simply to reset the page number per chapter, and
to use a "chapter-page" structure for page numbering; the package
provides a range of controls for various scenarios where it may be
used.

The package may be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of
the LaTeX Project Public License, version 1.3, or any later version
(at your option).  A copy of the appropriate licence statement is
available with any distribution of LaTeX, version 2003/12/01 or
later.  It may also be viewed on the LaTeX project web site at
